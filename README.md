Chrome Extension that converts any Cyrillic letters to Latin ones.
Supports every Cyrillic alphabet (Slavic and non-Slavic)!

Port Notes:
------
* Added refresh functionality to make the add-on/extension behave well on dynamic websites
* Added slavic version, which uses č, ć, đ, š and ž, instead of ch, sh, etc
* Thanks to oreoadidas for the original addon

How it works:
------
[Install by adding it](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/latinify/clhcmoeloccdehioknhbbdokpkceaoha/overview) to your Chrome.

Works when you load any page that contains Cyrillic alphabet, by automiatically converting it to Latin.
